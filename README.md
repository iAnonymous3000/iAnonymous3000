# üëã Hi there! I'm Sooraj Sathyanarayanan

I'm a cybersecurity and privacy researcher with a Master's in Cybersecurity from Northeastern University. My mission is to leverage cutting-edge computer science principles to tackle real-world security challenges and advocate for digital rights.

As a passionate researcher, I pioneer solutions that prioritize user autonomy and self-sovereign identity. I'm deeply passionate about open-source technologies, data privacy, and empowering individuals in the digital realm.

With professional experience spanning IT audit, penetration testing, vulnerability management, digital forensics, and threat research, I bring a comprehensive skill set to fortify defenses and investigate breaches.

Committed to fostering a security-aware community, I serve as the Chapter Lead at null NEU, a student-run organization dedicated to cybersecurity education and outreach.

My GitHub showcases my projects, contributions, and journey in this exciting field. Feel free to explore, collaborate, or reach out‚Äîlet's build a safer digital future together!
